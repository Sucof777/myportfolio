# Portfolio

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.7.

## Development server

The Angular application and the Express API can be started together with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command launches the Express server on `http://localhost:4000` (with SSR disabled for faster rebuilds) and the Angular CLI dev server on `http://localhost:4200`. A proxy configuration forwards `/api` requests from the Angular server to the Express instance so the frontend can call the backend without changing URLs. Both processes reload automatically when their source files change.

To run just the Angular application, use `npm start`. To work with the API in isolation, run `npm run serve:api` and send requests to `http://localhost:4000`.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Production deployment

The repository is configured for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) using the default Angular SSR output. A typical deployment pipeline performs the following steps:

1. Install dependencies: `npm ci`
2. Build the SSR bundle: `npm run build`
3. Upload the project root (including the generated `dist/portfolio` directory) to Vercel

The `/api/index.cjs` serverless function imports the Express app generated by the Angular build (`dist/portfolio/server/server.mjs`) so that every `/api/*` request is handled by the same code that runs locally. The accompanying `vercel.json` rewrite forwards all `/api/*` traffic to that function instead of falling back to a static 404 handler.

After the deployment completes, re-verify the contact endpoint against the live URL:

```bash
curl -i -X POST https://<your-vercel-domain>/api/contact \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"Jane Tester","email":"jane@example.com","message":"This is a message long enough to be accepted."}'
```

The serverless Express instance responds with `HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted` and the JSON payload `{ "message": "Message sent." }` when the deployment is healthy.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

Server-side API tests are implemented with Node's test runner. Execute them with:

```bash
npm run test:server
```

## Contact API configuration

The `/api/contact` endpoint forwards messages through SMTP using [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/). Configure the following environment variables before starting the server:

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CONTACT_SMTP_HOST` | Yes (unless `CONTACT_TRANSPORT=json`) | SMTP server host name. |
| `CONTACT_SMTP_PORT` | No | SMTP port (defaults to `587`). |
| `CONTACT_SMTP_SECURE` | No | Set to `true` to enforce SMTPS (defaults based on port). |
| `CONTACT_SMTP_USER` | Yes (unless `CONTACT_TRANSPORT=json`) | SMTP username. |
| `CONTACT_SMTP_PASS` | Yes (unless `CONTACT_TRANSPORT=json`) | SMTP password. |
| `CONTACT_RECIPIENT` | No | Override the email recipient (defaults to `ferizovicsuco3@gmail.com`). |
| `CONTACT_FROM_ADDRESS` | No | Explicit “from” address (defaults to the SMTP user or the sender email). |
| `CONTACT_TRANSPORT` | No | Set to `json` to use Nodemailer's JSON transport (useful for local testing). |

When running tests you can set `CONTACT_TRANSPORT=json` to avoid connecting to a real SMTP server. The development API script (`npm run serve:api`) sets this flag automatically so the `/api/contact` endpoint responds with HTTP 202 during local development.

### Verifying the contact form locally

With the development servers running (`npm run dev`), submit the contact form from the UI or issue a manual request:

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:4200/api/contact \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"Jane Tester","email":"jane@example.com","message":"This is a message long enough to be accepted."}'
```

The proxy forwards the request to the Express server which responds with status `202 Accepted` and the JSON payload `{ "message": "Message sent." }` when the payload is valid.

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Pushing changes to GitHub

This repository does not ship with a preconfigured remote. To simplify pushing your local work to GitHub, use the helper script:

```bash
# export the GitHub repository URL once
export GIT_REMOTE_URL=git@github.com:username/myportfolio.git

# push the current branch (defaults to the active branch)
bash scripts/push.sh

# or push an explicit branch name
bash scripts/push.sh main
```

If the `origin` remote is already configured, the script will reuse it. Otherwise, it will add the remote using `GIT_REMOTE_URL` and push the selected branch.
